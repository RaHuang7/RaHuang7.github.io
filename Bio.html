                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                  Welcome to Biology, the class most 10th graders take regardless of what academy they are in. In Biology class
                  much of what you learn is delivered via powerpoint and reading pathfinders and you should take notes in your journals
                  in preparation for the quizzes on each unit, as well as the Biology EOC at the end of the school year. Additionally,
                  there are journal checks often so you kind of have to do work in your journal and fill in the table of contents 
                  according to what Mr. Swarts assigns. Overall, if you complete all the assignments and pay attention in class, especially to 
                  the types of questions on the EOC, Biology should be a pretty easy course and the EOC, an easy one.

                  <td>
                    The first unit of the class. You will be introduced to what the Organic molecules are and what makes an Organic
                    Molecule (High energy C-C or C-H bonds). You will also learn the monomers of each orgainic molecule (Amino Acids
                    for Proteins, Glucose for Carbohydrates and Glycogen/Fatty Acids for Lipids) and generally this first unit is pretty 
                    simple as it introduces you to what'll be needed for the next few units. Additionally you learn how to write conclusions
                    here as well.

                  <td>
                    This unit expands on the first unit. You will learn about Digestion and how Polymers are broken down into Monomers
                    as well as Biosynthesis and how monomers are recontructed for the needs of the body and in the case of plants, reconstructed
                    into other organic biomolecules. Cellular respiration and the breaking down of glucose for energy in the form of ATP will also
                    be taught here. Additionally you will learn about the phospholipid bilayer and how molecules diffuse into and out of a cell via
                    osmosis to achieve equilibrium. Modeling of Biosynthesis and digestion will better help understand the transition from
                    monomer to polymer.

                  <td>
                    This unit will introduce DNA, as well as DNA replication of cells known as Mitosis. There will be drawing activities to
                    teach the double helix, the nitrogenous bases Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine as well as RNA and its unique base 
                    Uracil. Afterwards you will learn about proteins and enzymes and how DNA codes for proteins with the help of RNA.

                    This unit will introduce Meiosis and how gametes came to be. You will utilize the Punnett Square in modeling what offsprings 
                    will recieve what genetics from their parents and also learn about mutation in the process. Afterwards, you will learn about
                    the history of the Earth via the Geologic Clock and learn how evolution/natural selection over time caused certain orgainisms to
                    be how they currently are and how they've changed from their ancestors. The anole lizard activity will be the main focus at that
                    point in modeling evolution.

                    relationship between them is. A flash game called Sunny Meadows will be the focus at the start of the unit and after you learn about
                    how to trace carbon and energy in ecosystems and how big carbon pools are, there will be a presentation in groups. Also, finals will be 
                    an oral presentation in front of the class of something you learned in the school year.
