The purpose of this website is to provide upcoming 10th graders in the humanities academy with knowledge of what they will face in the school year. I'm sure that there are students who are anxious about what will happen later on in the year since I felt that way when I was in 10th grade (and probably will again in 11th). So by having a Syllabus of what will happen in the school year, I can help upcoming 10th graders be more prepared for what lies ahead of them, be it quizzes, EOCs or Exams. Having prior warnings is always good. Additionally, since I went through 10th grade challenges already and been through the challenges and stuff, I can advise what to do and what not to do. For example in the General Tips section I can warn them not to procrastinate like I did or to go to math tutoring, which I found beneficial during my time in 10th grade Algebra 2. So yeah, my website will both forewarn upcoming humanities 10th graders of what they'll have to face in the year and give my advice as well.




uh, just ignore this random stuff here...
