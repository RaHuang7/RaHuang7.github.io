                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                  Welcome to 10th grade Language Arts, where much of the material corresponds to what you learn in European History. 
                  Each Unit unit features a writing assigment of some sort along with reflection, as well as occasional art projects from time to time. 
                  Additionally, there is a End of Semester Portfolio at the end of each semester, where you compile all the essays/reflections
                  from said semester into one portfolio along with a semester evaluation/reflection. So expect a lot of writing in this class!
                  Other than that, a couple of books are assigned at times and sometimes there's even the luxury of movies. Generally, if
                  you pay attention and turn all your work in on time, this class should be a breeze.

                    The first unit of the class, the stories you can expect to read are "The Iliad", featuring the perspectives of Achilles and 
                    Hecter respectively, as well as several of Aesops Fables. There's two essays for the Iliad and the main themes to look out
                    for are characteristics of communities, consequences for dissenters who don't conform and how opposing forces are 
                    highlighted in a community by the author.

                    The second unit of the class features stories including: "Lais of the Werewolf", featuring a man turned 
                    Bisclarvet/uncivilized, and several portions from "Le Morte d'Arthur" which feature the destruction of everything
                    due to the lack of chivalry. The essay for both stories is pretty hefty so look out for common themes in both, such as 
                    common Chivalric values highlighted or behavior disapporoved traditionally.

                    values of the past and "Macbeth" which is about a soldier who tried to become king due to what he heard from 3 witches.
                    Both films feature in class movies and for the "Macbeth" essay, watch out for any themes and lessons highlighted by
                    Shakespeare throughout the book.

                    "Emma" make sure to pay attention to character action and take notes if needed as there will be a seminar afterwards on 
                    values brought up in the movie.

                    the project can be individual or group and involves creating a video, game, poster, etc on one of the stories. As for "The
                    Importance of being Earnest" pay attention to how Oscar Wilde mocks or highlights certain aspects of Victorian Era society 
                    for the essay afterwards.

                    theme that occurs throughout the book and write about it in the essay, such as the symbol of the conch. Additionally there will be
                    an episode of the "Twilight Zone" to correspond to the gang mentality/savageness shown in the book and a seminar afterwards on 
                    questions on the book so make sure to READ THE BOOK!

                <ul>
                  <li>When available, take the honors assignments. Its worth it!</li>
                  <li>Your essay's thesis should be at the end of the introductory paragraph and supported throughout
                  the essay.</li>
                  <li>On the topic of essays, don't just list too much evidence. Elaboration of said evidence is key!</li>
                  <li>Finally the conclusion should connect to Modern Society, not just restate everything in the introduction.</li>
                  <li>For the DRP and SBAC in the year, take your time and make sure to get enough sleep for those tests!</li>
                  <li>Talk to Mr. Maher, he's an awesome teacher and a cool guy if you get to know him.
                  But remember, teachers are people too so don't bother him with late work, especially near the end of the school year! </li>
                  <li> For additional information/help on a certain unit or if you are in PSA and
                  are for some reason here anyway, you can visit Mr. Maher's website
