                  Welcome to European History, the history option you're given if you opt for Humanities. I'll be honest, this course 
                  isn't exactly the easiest and throughout the school year you can expect to face many tests, seminars and art assignments.
                  The school year will culminate with a final art project as well as the dreaded AP European exam so you can expect this

                    In the first time period, units include the Renaissance, Protestant Reformation and Age of Exploration. 
                    <br> The Renaissance was a key event in Europe that reintroduced Western Europe to Classical Greek works
                    sparking humanism and Individualism.
                    <br> The Protestant Reformation was focused around the split of Catholics and Protestants due to the work of men like
                    Martin Luther and his 95 theses.
                    <br> The Age of Exploration revolved around Europeans exploring the world and discovering new things for themselves
                    such as the Americas.
                    <br>There will be quizzes on all three units as well your first introductions to FRQs, DBQs and SAs on the AP Euro.

                    In the second time period, units include the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment/Absolute Monarchy and the French Revolution/
                    Napoleon Bonaparte.
                    <br> The Scientific Revolution lead to many discoveries such as the Heliocentric view of the Universe, Inductive/Deductive
                    reasoning and the Laws of Motion by Sir Issac Newton.
                    <br> The Enlightenment was a result of the Scientific Revolution and Renaissance. Philosophers in Europe 
                    questioned the nature and values of humans as well as their governments. Additionally some rulers such as 
                    Joseph II and Catherine the Great tried to use these ideals to strengthen their rule.
                    <br> The French Revolution occured due to the ideas of the Enlightenment and saw an overthrow of the French Monarchy by the 
                    people. Shortly afterwards, Napoleon rose to power as Emperor, and reigned until his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
                    <br> Much like with the first 3 units, there will be a quiz on each unit here as well so study up!

                    In the third time period, units include the Age of Isms/Revolutions, Nationalism/Unification and the Industrial Revolution/
                    Age of Imperialism.
                    <br> After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, conservatists of Absolute Monarchy before the Enlightenment had to deal with
                    new views such as Liberalism, Utilitarianism, Socialism and Marxist Communism. 50 Revolutions across Europe followed the French Revolution
                    though many except Greece's liberation from the Ottoman Empire, failed.
                    <br> Utilizing the concepts of blood and iron (war and industry) Germany and Italy both unified under the leadership of 
                    Bismarck and Giuseppe Mazzini (the heart), Camillo Cavour (the head) and Giuseppe Garibaldi (the muscle) respectively. 
                    Pride in one's country/nationalism also spread.
                    <br> Due to Europe's innovations in the Industrial Revolution, from 3-crop rotation to factories, Europeans needed more land
                    and resources. As such they turned to Africa and Asia, cutting up territory for their own needs, under Social Darwinist
                    beliefs that they were superior and more "evolved".
                    <br> The quizzes for these are particularly long so studying is recommended.

                    The final time period will include the following units: World War I/Russian Revolution, World War II and the 
                    Cold War-Present Day.
                    <br> World War I occurred due to a variety of reasons. Many in Europe actually wanted a war to clear up economic and
                    political issues, until the war lasted longer they thought it would. In the end, the Big 4 (France, U.S., Great Britain,
                    Italy) rose to power, Germany, Austria and Ottoman Empire lost and Russia underwent a Communist Revolution/overthrew the 
                    Tsar and his family.
                    <br> World War II occurred once again due to Germany and extreme nationalism/Anti-Semitism. It lead to the creation of the 
                    Big 3 (U.S., Great Britain and Russia) as well the defeat of Germany, and Japan.
                    <br> The Cold War occurred immediately after World War II. With the creation of Nuclear Bombs, the Space Age and Opposing 
                    ideals of Democracy/Capitalism vs Communism/Socialism, Europe was divided (Berlin Wall) and tensions lasted until 1991 with the
                    collapse of the U.S.S.R. NATO and other European post-war Unities formed to prevent any more conflicts like the World Wars.
                    <br> Not only are there quizzes on each unit, there will also be a heavy focus on art. You will learn art from
                    Impressionism, to Cubism to modern day art and watch several documentaries on artists like Andy Warhol and Ai Wei Wei.
                    Additionally the final project on art will feature you making your own piece of modern art inspired by anything you 
                    learned previously in the year along with finals. Good Luck!
